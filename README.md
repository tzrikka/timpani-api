Thin, easy-to-use API wrappers for [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) workflows using [Timpani](https://github.com/tzrikka/timpani).

Technically, none of this is required in order to use Timpani, but it saves time, minimizes code duplication, and prevents mistakes.

Timpani is a [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) worker that sends API calls and receives asynchronous event notifications to/from various well-known third-party services.
